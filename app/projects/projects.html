                                    attendees. Both facilitator and attendees will install this app. Facilitator can set
                                    up
                                    lectures according to their timetable in their app. To make the initial setup easy,
                                    facilitator can directly import file from their mobile.(Here is the
                                    format:https://github.com/rujoota/CSC780_Attendance/blob/master/students.txt)

                                    with their mobile. Facilitator can view and export the reports about the students.
                                    Students can only view their report.

                                    This app is an extension to Google/Apple calendar and makes the regular calendar
                                    easy-to-use, intuitive and fun.
                                    This app is mainly used for analyzing your day-to-day lifecycle and present your
                                    daily routine and life-patterns in a way so that you

                                    efficiently. Better yet, it automatically creates events for users from user’s
                                    location and associates additional information with it.
                                    This app presents all this information to users in normal calendar views as well as
                                    map-views so that users get a feel of time-line.
                                    Also, this app auto-syncs all the events with apple/google calendar on cloud so that
                                    user’s privacy is maintained and information is
                                    not lost even when the phone is dead. This app proves one-stop shop for all kinds of
                                    event organization.

                                    This version is specifically built for iPhone users. So it uses iOS swift as
                                    programming language.
                                    It uses google places api to get detailed information about a specific location.
                                    Most of the data is stored internally using Apple's core-data or iCloud.

                                    This a website is developed in php, html5, bootstrap and MySQL. This website can be
                                    used to search restaurants and reserve
                                    tables with specified date and time and number of people. I lead the team of 5
                                    people working in this project and we followed agile methodology.
                                    It has modules for different kinds of users like host/hostess, restaurant owner and
                                    admin.

                                    <li>General user can search for tables, view details of a restaurant and reserve it
                                        and provide review about a restaurant.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Host/hostess: can check reservation list and mark a particular reservation. Only
                                        guests who has made reservation and has
                                        been marked can provide review for that restaurant.

                                    Cards of wild is part of bunch of mini-games from 'world of balance' game stack. Its
                                    a 2-player game where both players are given deck of animal-cards to play with. The
                                    cards can attack opponent's card as well as his/her tree('tree of life'). Each card
                                    and tree has specific health points and using animal food chaining rules one has to

                                    We have a game-lobby server which is common for all the games and Cards of wild has
                                    its independent server which receives all requests related to our game. We used
                                    unity as game-client and Java for server development. Our game runs on android
                                    devices as well.

                                    This is one player game. That player is combined of two elements (called Pop and Katch). Pop bounces around and destroys the enemies and Katch directs Pop in which direction to go and provides protection. The player needs to control Katch by using left and right arrows so that it can save Pop and direct it in proper direction in such a way that Pop collides with enemy and destroys them. The game is over when either player’s health is over or main enemy BigLeg is destroyed.

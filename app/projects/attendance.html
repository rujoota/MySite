    This app is built in Android which lets facilitator take attendance for students or
    attendees. Both facilitator and attendees will install this app. Facilitator can set up
    lectures according to their timetable in their app. To make the initial setup easy,
    facilitator can directly import file from their mobile.(Here is the
    format:https://github.com/rujoota/CSC780_Attendance/blob/master/students.txt)
    Facilitator can scan NFC tag first which allows some data relavant to current lecture
    transferred to the tag and then students can fill attendance by just scanning these tags
    with their mobile. Facilitator can view and export the reports about the students.
    Students can only view their report.
